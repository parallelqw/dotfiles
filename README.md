# dotfiles

Huge credit for @AmadeusWM and @Fausto-Korpsvart

Amadeus owns the dots itself (with catppuccin) and Fausto owns Gruvbox GTK Theme.

This dot simply a modified version of Amadeus's dot. But with Gruvbox.

Wallpapers are removed, since it makes repo bloated. In hypr/scripts/autostart, you'll see "swaybg -i wallpaper.png" which means it will set wallpaper via swaybg and set the wallpaper on home named wallpaper.png.

You can find all required packages here(Inspected PKGBUILD's by myself at 04.17.2023):
